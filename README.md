# Distribuição de respiradores no sudeste do Brasil (Distribution of respirators in the southeast of Brasil)
This is a project I made during my graduation at Universidadde Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP).
The project used a public database of the brazillian health system that shows the distribution of the respirators during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil.
The data I chose is related to the most populous region of Brazil, which contains 4 states: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais.
It is a simple script which allows the user to analyze the data according to the options given in the terminal when the program is executed.
